## Bayes Theorem
$$
\begin{align}
1. \kern20px & P(A ,\ B) = P(B ,\ A)
\\[5px]
2. \kern20px & P(A ,\ B)= P(A) \cdot P(B \ | \ A) \\
&  P(B ,\ A)= P(B) \cdot P(A \ | \ B)
\\[5px]
3. \kern20px & P(A \ | \ B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}\kern3pxP(B \ | \ A)
\end{align}
$$
Where:
- $P(A \ | \ B)$ is the conditional probability (a **pdf**) of the event $A$ happening in case of being in the condition of $B$, for example: 
$A =$ *probability of picking a girl in a crowd*
$B =$ *being in a engineering university*
$P(A) = 0.51$ (we consider the more general case, in the world the percentage of female is $52\%$ and of males is $48\%$ )
$P(A \ | \ B) = 0.20$ (in an engineering course the percentage of females is around $20\%$)
