## Discriminant Functions
Let $\underline{x}$ be the vector of features.
Let $\omega_i$ be the class to which $\underline{x}$ belongs.
We need a function $g$ such that 
$$
g(\omega_i ,\ \underline{x}) \gt g(\omega_j ,\ \underline{x})
\kern30px \forall \, j\neq i
$$
So that we can recognize to which class $\underline{x}$ belongs.
