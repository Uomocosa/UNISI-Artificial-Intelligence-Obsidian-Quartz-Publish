##### Why is SOFTMAX used?
“*Any time we wish to represent a probability distribution over a discrete variable with n possible values, we may use the SOFTMAX function. This can be seen as a generalization of the sigmoid function which was used to represent a probability distribution over a binary variable.*”

“*SOFTMAX units naturally represent a probability distribution over a discrete variable with k possible values, so they may be used as a kind of switch.*”
