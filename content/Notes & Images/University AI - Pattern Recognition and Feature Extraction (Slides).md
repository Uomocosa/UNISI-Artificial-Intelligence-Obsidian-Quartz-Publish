- ***Prior Probability*** : a **prior probability distribution**, often simply called the **prior**, of an uncertain quantity is the probability distribution that would express one's beliefs about this quantity before some evidence is taken into account (~Ex.: $P(\omega_i)$)
- ***Posterior Probability***: results from updating the prior probability with information summarized by the likelihood, through an application of Bayes' theorem.
- ***Likelihood***: The **likelihood function** (often simply called the **likelihood**) is the joint probability of the observed data viewed as a function of the **parameters**, the likelihood may be found written as $P(\underline{x_0} \ | \ \underline{\Theta})$ to emphasize that it provides the probability of observing sample $\underline{x_0}$ given $\underline{\Theta}$ the vector of the parameters.
